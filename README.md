# Bamazon Node App

### About The Project
Bamazon is a command line node app that creates an Amazon-like storefront with MySQL. Customers can view inventory, purchase products, and watch the inventory quantities decrease. Managers can view all products, view products with low inventory (less than 5), add quantities to existing products, and add new products entirely.
